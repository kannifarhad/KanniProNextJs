    <p>Dear [Recruiter’s or Hiring Manager’s Name],</p>

    <p>
      I am writing to express my keen interest in the [Position Title] opportunity at [Company Name], as recently discussed. With over a decade of hands-on experience as a full-stack engineer and team
      leader, I have successfully delivered complex projects across diverse domains—including SaaS platforms, MLOps tools for scientific research, and conversational AI systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my most recent roles, I led the development of an AI-powered appointment scheduling platform, architected scalable microservices with Node.js and PostgreSQL, and created intuitive front-end
      experiences using React, TypeScript, MUI, and modern state management libraries. For AI integration I had used LangChain, LangGraph, OpenAI, RAG and PostgreSQL-Vector DB. I have a strong focus on code quality, developer experience, and building tools that scale well under real-world
      constraints.
    </p>

    <p>
      My technical knowledge includes wide range of technologies such as React, Redux, React Query, NestJS, Express, Apollo Federation, PrismaORM, Sequelize, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Kubernetes,
      and cloud platforms like AWS and Azure. Additionally, I’ve worked extensively with DevOps tools (Docker, Jenkins, Vault, Consul), monitoring (ELK, Grafana), and CI/CD practices to ensure
      efficient delivery pipelines and high availability.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond my technical skills, I bring strong leadership and communication abilities, having mentored junior developers and collaborated closely with customers, product managers, and executives to
      align technical solutions with business objectives.
    </p>

    <p>Thank you for time and I look forward to discussing the details.</p>
